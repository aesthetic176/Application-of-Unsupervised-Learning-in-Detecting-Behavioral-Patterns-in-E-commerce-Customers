# Unsupervised Learning in E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the "Unsupervised Learning in E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis" project. This repository contains our exploration and application of unsupervised machine learning techniques in understanding and segmenting customer behaviors in the e-commerce sector.

## Project Overview
This project aims to uncover patterns in customer behavior using the Online Retail dataset. We apply Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis combined with machine learning techniques like KMeans clustering to segment customers into distinct groups. This approach helps in understanding diverse shopping patterns and tailoring business strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
Our study uses the "Online Retail" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises extensive sales data from a UK-based e-commerce business, ideal for analyzing customer preferences and buying patterns.

## Methodology
- **RFM Analysis**: We compute RFM values for each customer and standardize the data for clustering.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Customers are segmented based on their RFM metrics, using the KMeans algorithm.
- **Silhouette Score Analysis**: This method helps us determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation.

## Results
We have successfully segmented customers using KMeans clustering based on RFM metrics, revealing distinct buying behaviors. Our results are visualized using tools like Seaborn's pairplot, highlighting the clear distinctions among different customer segments.

## Contribution
Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to this project. Whether you're a data scientist, e-commerce professional, or student, your insights and feedback are invaluable.

Join us in advancing the application of machine learning in the e-commerce domain!
